Leonard...

27
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,570
I've got terrible news.

28
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,010
What's going on?

29
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,600
Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow.

30
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,160
You're face is pleasingly symmetrical.

31
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,950
Just tell me.

32
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,780
A Swedish team of physicists

33
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,230
is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.

34
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,100
Oh, well, that kind of stinks.

35
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,860
"That kind of stinks"?

36
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,440
Why aren't you more upset?

37
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,140
Did I soften the blow too much?

38
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,370
Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.

39
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,680
What are we going to do?

40
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,250
Perform the experiment immediately.

41
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,850
I'd love to, but we need liquid helium

42
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,950
and our shipment's on back order for a month.

43
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,100
A month? What? Are you kidding me?

44
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,750
That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.

45
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,140
That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.

46
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,880
Thank you. Aren't you sweet.

47
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,390
Let's go check to see if the university

48
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,090
has any helium in reserve.

49
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,840
Did you know that I almost didn't wear this shirt today?

50
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,270
Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.

51
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,480
We need liquid helium-- 

52
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,040
does the department have any we can use?

53
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,280
Sorry, there's a shortage.

54
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,370
And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.

55
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,460
But you won't need much for that.

56
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,750
True, but if it's successful,

57
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm having a party with balloons.

58
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,670
Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team

59
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,190
trying to run our experiment before us.

60
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,510
Can't you spare any?

61
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,340
Be honest-- if the shoe was on the other foot,

62
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,000
would you do this for me?

63
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,960
- Yes. - No chance.

64
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,720
What are you doing?

65
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,820
He said be honest, so I was honest.

66
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,010
Didn't your mother tell you? It's the best policy.

67
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,200
So, what do you say?

68
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,540
Hell no.

69
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,980
He could've softened the blow.

70
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,520
Why do you need Kripke?

71
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,850
Can't you just go to Party City for helium?

72
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,820
We'd have to go to every Party City in California.

73
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,940
Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.

75
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,640
Hey, people were still talking about that party

76
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,660
on siete de Mayo.

77
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,790
Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us,

78
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,890
I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again.

79
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,150
Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs

80
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,880
are my favorite toothpick-delivered meatball.

81
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,330
If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy

82
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,780
who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.

83
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,790
- Who is he? - Where does he work?

84
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,420
How does he get the helium?

85
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
How many questions are too many questions?

86
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,090
Maybe he's not for you.

87
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,400
Four questions. There answer's four.

88
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,460
Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? 

89
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,420
Stuart.

90
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,360
Oh, good for him.

91
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,490
I thought so, too.

92
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,510
So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?

93
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,020
He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.

94
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,780
Oh, which one?

95
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,240
Maybe we can get Amy to try it.

96
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,490
I don't know.

97
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,830
Stuart, can you come in here?

98
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,660
He tried to explain it to me.

99
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,790
It shows you pictures of people nearby,

100
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,860
you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.

101
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,220
Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.

102
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,800
What's up?

103
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,630
Can you show us that dating app?

104
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,100
Oh, yeah, sure.

105
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,980
This thing has changed my life.

106
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,630
Wow. So how many girls have you met?

107
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,570
Two.

108
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,460
I probably don't need to mention

109
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,560
there's an entire number between that and zero.

110
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,340
Well, so how does it work?

111
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,880
Uh, well, it-it shows me all

112
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,250
the single women in a five-mile radius

113
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,510
who are using the app.

114
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,940
If I like the way they look, I hit "Thumbs up."

115
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,570
If I don't, "Thumbs down."

116
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,150
Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?

117
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,760
First time it happens I will let you know.

118
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,330
Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,820
What's he say?

120
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,360
He's got what we need and can meet us tonight.

121
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,560
Oh, really?

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,300
You know I don't like buying things at night.

123
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,310
January 7, 2009.

124
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,200
I went to the Ralph's at 11:30pm to pick up

125
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,320
Cracklin' Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,820
The man restocking the cereal shelves.

127
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,340
That's right. And what did he do?

128
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,850
He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.

129
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,980
It's like it was yesterday.

130
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,230
Do you want liquid helium or not?

131
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,300
Of course I do.

132
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
I don't want that Swedish team scooping us.

133
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
Then I'm going to tell him we're in.

134
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,570
Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.

135
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,030
We're just bending the rules a little.

136
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,500
We have grant money to do the experiment,

137
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,810
so we're going to spend it on the helium we need.

138
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,640
It's not like when Dr. Goldfarb

139
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,790
claimed he bought an electron microscope

140
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,610
and he was really just keeping

141
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,850
a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.

142
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,750
Was she helping him with his research?

143
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,450
Sure.

144
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,250
So, are we doing this?

145
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,970
Okay, but where does he get the helium?

146
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,660
Remember? Don't ask too many questions?

147
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,870
Uh, but this is violating university code.

148
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,500
A little, but...

149
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,000
if I may quote Einstein,

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
"The pursuit of science calls us

151
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,140
to ignore the rules set by man."

152
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,090
All right, do it.

153
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,610
Tell him we're in.

154
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,110
Done.

155
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,340
I can't find that quote on the Internet.

156
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,070
Did you make that up?

157
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,570
Before I answer,

158
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,520
may I just say your skin has never looked better.

159
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,920
Aren't you just made of sugar.

160
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,700
I'm not sure how I feel about this.

161
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,380
Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.

162
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,510
Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.

163
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,100
One of which would've ended in sex had she not said no.

164
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,050
Okay, all set.

165
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,260
Okay, let me see.

166
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,810
Nope, nope,

167
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,160
nope...

168
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,840
Oh, he's cute!

169
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,310
Doesn't a teardrop tattoo

170
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,810
mean he murdered someone?

171
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,310
And he's sad about it.

172
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,720
Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,780
If you wanted me to stay out later,

174
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,300
you should've given me more spending money.

175
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,530
What are you guys up to?

176
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,790
We put Amy on a dating app,

177
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,140
and we're seeing what's out there.

178
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,430
Oh, fun! Let me see.

179
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,730
Uh, no...

180
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,960
no, uh, definitely not.

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,260
What was wrong with that guy?

182
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,150
Uh, he's Indian.

183
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,450
We've already got one of those.

184
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,330
Ooh, we should find a nice Latino.

185
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,210
It really round us out.

186
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,960
Hey, I want to try.

187
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,710
Uh, excuse me, c-can I have my phone back?

188
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,180
Hang on, I'm trying to find you the next great love of your life.

189
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,910
The man who will father your children.

190
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,990
Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?

192
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,870
That must be him. 

193
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,150
Oh, of course.

194
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,980
An nondescript, white panel van.

195
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,790
You may be familiar with it from the sentence:

196
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,050
"Their bodies were found 

197
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,630
in a nondescript, white panel van."

198
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
What's up?

199
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,790
Uh, I'm Leonard.

200
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,150
- This is my friend-- - I'm Skippy.

201
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,840
Skippy Cavanaugh.

202
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
Great.

203
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,120
You got the cash?

204
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,420
Uh, yeah, uh, right here.

205
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,830
Wait, hold on, hold on.

206
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,020
How do we know that you're not gonna

207
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,380
take the money and drive away?

208
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,480
What ya doing, Skippy?

209
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,950
Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us.

210
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,460
You give us the helium first.

211
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,800
Oh, how do I know you're not gonna

212
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,830
drive away without paying me?

213
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,480
Guess I'm not the only one

214
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,920
who watches '70s television crime dramas.

215
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,920
Look, you can trust us.

216
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,660
We're respected scientists.

217
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, he is.

218
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,210
I'm a wedding planner,

219
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,350
who can't find love himself.

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
It's ironic, but the point is

221
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,140
we can't trust you.

222
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,210
You're a sketchy character in a parking garage.

223
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,450
Yeah, well, from my perspective,

224
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,430
that's how you two appear to me.

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,060
Well, I never thought of it like that.

226
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,340
Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won't it?

227
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,020
My friend does make a decent point about the money.

228
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,280
I don't feel comfortable just handing it over up front.

229
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,970
Ah-ah-ah, no money, no helium.

230
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,020
Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.

231
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,640
Not technically.

232
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,050
In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation

233
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,810
in which there are no remaining moves.

234
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,770
Uh, you have plenty of moves available.

235
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,190
You could beat us up and steal the money.

236
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,270
You could kill us, you know.

237
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,690
Really, you're only limited by your imagination.

238
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,920
All these years, I've been using "stalemate,"

239
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,130
when I really mean "impasse."

240
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,190
I feel foolish.

241
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,730
I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate

242
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,890
or an impasse or a Mexican standoff.

244
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,840
What are we gonna do here?

245
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,710
Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it be a Mexican standoff?

246
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,160
Everybody knows you need three sides for that.

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,750
Not necessarily.

248
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,060
Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff

249
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,090
is that no one can walk away from the conflict

250
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,070
without incurring harm.

251
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,830
Hmm, I don't follow.

252
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,560
Let me give you an example.

253
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,270
Earlier today,

254
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,390
I decoded the headers on your e-mail,

255
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,680
and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald.

256
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,470
From that, I figured out where you live and where you work.

257
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,720
Now, to make this a Mexican standoff,

258
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,300
I would say something like, uh,

259
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,250
"You give us the helium or I'll turn you in to the authorities."

260
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
Is that a threat?

261
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,660
Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.

262
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,730
Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right?

263
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,440
And if you mess with me, I'll report you,

264
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,520
then I'll pound your asses into the ground.

265
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,450
Perfect! Now we really are in a Mexican standoff.

266
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,930
Is this one of those times

267
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,960
where I've won the battle but lost the war?

268
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,070
Afraid so, Skippy.

269
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,580
I told you we shouldn't go shopping at night.

270
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,830
All right, let's all just calm down.

271
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,500
Nobody wants to report anybody.

272
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,760
No, I don't like this. I'm out.

273
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,050
No, no, no. Wait, don't go.

274
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,820
Just let me explain.

275
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,520
We're physicists, and we're trying to prove a hypothesis 

276
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,670
that we've been working on for over a year.

277
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,640
Really? What's the hypothesis?

278
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,990
Space-time can be interpreted as

279
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,380
the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.

280
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,000
Could be, could be.

281
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,080
Go on.

282
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay, but now there's this Swedish team that read our paper

283
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,210
and they're trying to beat us to our own discovery.

284
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,780
We really need this helium.

285
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,040
And I'm sorry I lied about

286
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,610
being a wedding planner who can't find love.

287
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,960
Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.

288
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,720
Here's the money. Can we do this?

289
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,950
Okay.

290
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,660
It's a shame about those scientists ripping you off.

291
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,250
I expected a higher ethical standard

292
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,230
from our friends in Sweden.

293
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,170
It's actually pretty common in our field.

294
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,980
Not much you can do about it.

295
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,270
Well, for the right amount of money,

296
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,050
if you know where they live,

297
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,440
there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.

298
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,720
Did you hear that, Leonard?

299
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,840
There's plenty we could do about it.

300
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,120
Do you have a card?

301
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,670
Okay, here we go.

302
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,090
Now everyone can see.

303
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,790
All right.

304
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,450
Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?

305
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,560
You know he won't be looking at other girls.

306
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,210
Unless they're sitting on the end of his nose.

307
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,700
Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down.

308
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,270
Next.

309
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,330
Ew, check out his tiny teeth.

310
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,430
He looks like a man-dolphin.

311
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,270
Wait, if he's good in bed, she can throw him a fish.

312
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,910
I love you, Amy.

313
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,310
Okay, I'm starting to feel guilty.

314
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,680
Aren't we being a little mean?

315
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,740
That's a fair point.

316
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,940
We wouldn't make fun of someone like this to their face.

317
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,440
Look, it's Stuart!

318
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,040
You may want to leave the room.

319
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,710
Right this way, Uncle Harvey.

320
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,770
Will you stop with that already?

321
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,610
I'm trying not to attract attention.

322
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,280
And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn't do that?

323
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,300
She said, "Buenas noches." What was he supposed to do?

324
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,800
Let's just start the experiment.

325
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,530
Leonard, we should probably have our story straight

326
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,680
in case we get caught.

327
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,870
We're not getting caught.

328
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,650
Well, you can't be sure of that.

329
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,170
What if the helium dealer rats us out?

330
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,880
What if Kripke asks where we got it?

331
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,060
What if the university checks my family tree

332
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,040
and finds out I don't have an Uncle Harvey?

333
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,290
The dealer doesn't care, Kripke has no authority over us,

334
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,370
and you being related to a metal container

335
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,220
would explain a lot.

336
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,550
Help me hook this up.

337
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,490
What?

338
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,370
- Well, did you see this sticker? - What is it?

339
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,110
It's partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads:

340
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,500
"Property of" and the letter "U."

341
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,040
It's probably USC or UCLA.

342
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,340
Yeah, but what if it's "Property of U.S. Government"?

343
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,100
There's a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas.

344
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,380
If this was stolen from there,

345
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,780
we're accessories to a federal crime.

346
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,270
Let's not jump to conclusions.

347
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,940
A lot of things start with "U."

348
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,160
That's true.

349
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,510
There's the U.S. Air Force,

350
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,040
U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Navy,

351
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,310
"You" And I are going to jail.

352
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,060
Listen, we can do the experiment as planned

353
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,660
and beat the Swedish team to the punch,

354
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,280
or we can kiss our dreams good-bye 

355
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,240
because we were to afraid to break a few rules.

356
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,500
Ma'am.

357
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,340
Okay, does everyone remember the rules?

358
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,730
If he's shirtless, one sip.

359
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,140
Posing with a pet, two sips.

360
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,030
Pet and shirtless, chug like it's your job.

361
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,210
And pull!

362
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,750
I have that same underwear!

363
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,410
Chug!

364
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,170
Mm, Amy, you're getting a text.

365
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,510
Oh, um, give me that.

366
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,630
"I had a great time last night."

368
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,100
No, no, st-stop reading that.

369
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,260
- Who's Dave?  - I...

370
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,190
You went on a date last night?

371
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,360
Are you seeing someone?

372
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
No, it-it's not like that.

373
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,570
"And I'd love to take you out again"?

374
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,740
- Amy! - What?

375
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,130
- Can't believe it. - Oh, my God.

376
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,130
Okay, it's like that.

377
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,610
Thank you for coming back.

378
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,100
Yeah, well, normally I wouldn't,

379
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,980
but my daughter's having a sleepover, and there's only

380
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,870
so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.

382
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,920
Anyway, if you could just give us our money back,

383
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,460
you can have your helium and we'll be on our way.

384
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,210
Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?

385
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,760
No, nothing. We just changed our mind.

386
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,670
He has glasses and I'm a know-it-all;

387
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,670
we are not built for prison.

388
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,590
Yeah, I hear you.

389
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,010
Well, you're good guys, so I'll, uh...

390
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,060
I'll take the helium off your hands.

391
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,370
Thank you.

392
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,820
But you ain't getting your money back.

393
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,490
You're taking advantage of us?

394
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,600
We clarified nomenclature together.

395
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,720
Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, 

396
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,950
but, uh, this is business.

397
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,190
You know what?

398
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,450
It's fine. Keep the money.

399
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,080
We just want to be done with this.

400
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,870
No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you

401
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,460
a small helium restocking fee.

402
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,800
I don't understand.

403
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,410
He wants more money.

404
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,980
Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars;

405
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,890
that's all I've got on me.

406
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,940
That's exactly how much it is.

407
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:08,950
Finally,

408
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,870
something breaks our way.

409
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,220
I can't believe you're seeing someone

410
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,690
and we don't even know about it.

411
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,440
Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,020
Because it's new and weird

413
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,410
and I'm just trying to figure it all out.

414
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,970
And I knew if I told you guys 

415
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,530
I had been out with a few people 

416
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,980
that you'd get way too excited about it.

417
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,580
A few people?

418
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,580
- What?! - Amy!

419
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,600
So, are we allowed to ask how it's going?

420
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,910
It's going fine.

421
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,990
It's mostly just been meeting people for coffee.

422
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,010
Wha...?!

423
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,420
I thought we were all...

424
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,760
Never mind.

425
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,230
I-I thought you weren't ready to start seeing people.

426
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,330
Well, I don't have much experience dating,

427
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,970
so I decided it would be good for me

428
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,930
to, you know, get out there a little.

429
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,520
Well, good for you.

430
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,110
Thank you.

431
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,410
And how many guys have you gone out with?

432
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,550
Please be less than two.

433
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,760
- Three. - Damn it.

434
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,320
Well, the Swedes might beat us,

435
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,360
but at least we won't get gang-noogied in prison.

436
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,880
Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you've seen?

438
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,770
It scared me straight, Leonard.

439
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,750
Hey, I've been thinking.

440
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,450
I was being petty.

441
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,510
You can have my helium.

442
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,680
Thank you, Barry.

443
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,920
But you have to add my name to your paper.

444
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,990
That's preposterous.

445
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,300
I don't know, seems fair.

446
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,940
You can't do it without me.

447
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,770
Can you give us a minute?

448
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,870
Take your time.

449
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,830
I'll walk out backwards for dramatic effect.

450
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,180
I don't like being extorted like this.

451
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,960
Especially by him of all people.

452
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,900
Me neither, but what other choice do we have?

453
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,690
I promise this is the last time.

454
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,180
It's says right here on the Wikipedia

455
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,390
"A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between

456
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,040
at least three parties."

457
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,990
How can you trust Wikipedia

458
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,560
if they use "between" to refer to three parties?

459
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,740
They should've used "among," right?

460
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,470
Or "amongst," if they were feeling whimsically archaic.

461
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,060
All right, enough with the chitchat.

462
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,360
Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?

463
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,280
Absolutely.

464
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,300
But don't be surprised if this movie sets you

465
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,320
on the straight and narrow.

466
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,820
I am open to change.

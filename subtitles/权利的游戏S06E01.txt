干掉疲倦不堪  寡不敌众的拜拉席恩
and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons
能与迎战准备万全  兵强马壮的兰尼斯特相提并论吗

不能

他们必将挥师讨伐
A reckoning will come.
我们需要北境的力量

你在她身上耍你那套把戏
You played your games with her.
在铁群岛的继承人身上耍你那套把戏
You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands
现在他们都逃了

我派了一队人马  带着最好的猎狗去抓他们
I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.
他们逃不远
They won't get far.
很好

不能停下
We can't stop.
我们必须过河
We have to cross here.
-我做不到  -只有这样才能甩掉猎犬
- I can't. - It's the only way to throw off the hounds.
太冷了  不行  我过不去  我会死的
But it's too cold. I can't. I won't make it. I'll die.
我见过他的猎犬怎么折磨人
I've seen what his hounds do to a person.

别想了
Don't think about it.
我必须想

I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.
她已经解脱了  她走了
She's not suffering. She's gone.
没人能再伤害她

她是我女儿  是我辜负了她
She was my daughter and I failed her.
不  我早知道会这样
No, I knew this would happen.
那女巫多年前就告诉我了
The witch told me years ago.
她预言我会有三个儿女  但他们都会死
She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.
"以黄金为裹尸布"

她说的一切都成了真
Everything she said came true.
你不可能阻止的

父亲死的那天  你对我说过
You told me yourself when Father died.
你说我们必须团结在一起
You said we had to stay together.
你说他们会将我们撕裂  夺去我们的一切
You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.
那也是个预言
That was a prophecy, too.
我没听你的  你说的一切都成了真
I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.
去他妈的预言  去他妈的命运
Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate.
除了我们  都他妈去死
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

七层地狱中挤满了圣洁之人的灵魂
"The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.
他们痛苦地嚎叫  他们的羞耻之强烈
They scream in agony and their shame is so great,
使他们连火焰也感觉不到
they do not feel the flames,
他们终于明白  若不是隐瞒了一桩罪行
for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed,
他们早已获得救赎
they were saved."

你的丈夫非常想念你
Your husband misses you dearly.
夫妻之间的爱是神圣的
The love between a man and wife is sacred.
体现了诸神对世人的爱
It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.
然而罪孽使我们背离神圣
But sin leads us away from the sacred.
只有忏悔才能净化罪孽
And only confession can purge sin.
我没什么要忏悔的
I have nothing to confess.
那么你相信自己是纯洁的
So you believe you are pure?
完美的
Perfect?
无可指摘

与各国的勇士战斗
Fought men from every country.
睡过世界上最漂亮的女人
Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
-和男人  -对  还有男人

他什么都经历过
He experienced everything
而我只能坐在这里
while I sat here in Dorne
为多恩的子民安居乐业而竭尽心力
trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.
但这就是生活
But that is life.
每个人都有自己的角色
We each have our roles.
奥柏伦生来就是冒险家
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.
而我生来就是统治者
And I was born to rule.
诸神不是傻瓜
The gods are not fools.
你会是个差劲的冒险家
You would have been a lousy adventurer.
至于奥柏伦
And Oberyn, pfft,
他一定是个糟糕的统治者
he would have been a terrible ruler.
你知道吗  你母亲是个充满智慧的女人
Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?
道朗亲王

伊莉亚·马泰尔被奸杀  你什么都没做
Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.
奥柏伦·马泰尔惨遭屠戮  你还是无动于衷

你不配做多恩人
You're not a Dornishman.
你不配做我们的亲王
You're not our prince.
我的儿子崔斯丹
My son Trystane...
你的儿子跟你一样软弱
Your son is weak just like you.
多恩再也不会被软弱的人统治了
And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
我说过我不饿
I told you I'm not hungry.
我们不是来给你送食物的
We're not here to feed you.
我们是来取你小命的
We're here to kill you.
你想死在谁手上  她还是我

你是个贪婪的小婊子  知道吗
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?
我们要想解决这座城市的问题
We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city
坐在八百呎高的金字塔上可不行
from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
不会有事的
We'll be fine.
我们的打扮跟普通商人没什么两样
We're dressed like common merchants.
你走起路来像个富人
You walk like a rich person.
你花了不少精力研究富人走路的样子吗
You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
你走起路来就好像这石板路是你自家的一样

我还是小男孩的时候专门偷你这种人
I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
幸好你已经不是小男孩了

-是谁写的呢  -这可说不准
- Who wrote it? - Hard to know.
我们的女王在弥林可没有以前那么受欢迎了
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
是鹰身女妖之子干的
The Sons of the Harpy?
很有可能
Very possibly.
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安夺走了他们最珍贵的财产
Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,
还告诉他们人本来就不是财产
told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.
你应该明白他们为什么不开心吧
You can see why they're unhappy.
当然
Of course,
也有可能是自由人干的
it could also be the freed men.
因为长夜黑暗  处处险恶
光之王派龙之母来拯救你们
那些心向黑暗的人却赶走了她
许多曾经的奴隶觉得丹妮莉丝把他们抛弃了
Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
她的确驾龙高飞  没有回来
She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
你们要怎样回应
你们是紧握双手等待龙之母的归来
还是接过她的火炬
没有丹妮莉丝女王  你们会为自我救赎而战吗
这是个难题
It's a problem.
恐惧导致弥林停滞不前
Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.
不管你是谁  不管你去哪
Whoever you are, wherever you go,
城里总有人想置你于死地
someone in this city wants to murder you.
我们连敌人是谁都不知道  谈何战斗
We can't fight an enemy we don't know.
鹰身女妖之子在竞技场发动的袭击
The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack
可谓深思熟虑
in the fighting pits very carefully,
说明他们背后有人操纵
which means they take orders from someone.
你开始着手找这个人了吗
And have you started looking for that someone?
我的小小鸟已经飞上天了
My little birds have already taken wing.
它们很快就会唱着黄金面具的歌儿飞回来
Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.
看来我们暂时去不成维斯特洛了
Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.
山羊吗
Goat?
公羊
Ram.
你认为是咱们的朋友干的
You think our friend got him?
不知道除了它还有谁能融化公羊的角
Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.
这么说我们走对了路
We're on the right path, then.
也许她心生倦意了
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.
我认为她不太喜欢当女王
I don't think she likes it very much.
她那么聪明  当然不喜欢
She's too smart to like it.
说不定她飞到别处去了
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,
离我们这种人远远的
somewhere far away from men like us.
我去过很多地方
I've been all over the world.
没见过我们这样的逃亡者
There's no escaping men like us.
不想从她身边逃走吧
There's no escaping her, eh?
走了又回来  为什么
You keep coming back. Why?
你知道为什么
You know why.
很痛苦吧
Isn't it frustrating
爱上一个对你毫无感觉的人
wanting someone who doesn't want you back?
当然
Of course it is.
你真是浪漫  我佩服你
You're a romantic. I admire that.
有时看着你  我就会想
Sometimes I look at you and I think,
我老了以后也是这样吧
"So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."
只要你能活到老
If you grow old.
只要我能活到老
If I grow old.
但愿吧
I hope I do.
我想亲眼看看
I want to see what the world looks like
被她征服的世界
when she's done conquering it.
我也想
So do I.
军队吗
Huh, an army?
不是军队
Not an army.
是部落
A horde.
多斯拉克人
Dothraki?
他们把她抓走了
They have her.
她可能见过鬼魂
我朋友的母亲见过鬼魂  然后头发变白了
粉人害怕太阳
皮肤会被灼伤
她在太阳底下站了太久  头发就变白了
你说她的阴毛是白的吗
你干过白阴毛的女孩吗
就干过你奶奶一个
我会请求摩洛卡奥把你送给我睡一晚
你觉得怎么样
眼睛很美  但人太傻
撅着屁股又不用动脑筋
我干完了喜欢说话  否则跟狗没什么两样
不
No.
献给你  我的卡奥
在丘陵里找到的白发女孩
看看她的嘴唇  吾血之血
蓝眼女人都是女巫
大家都知道
砍了她的头  别叫她给你施了咒语
就算我眼瞎了
一听到我的老婆们说
砍了她的头
我就知道这女人一定很美
好在我没有瞎
第一次看漂亮女人的裸体
还有更美妙的事情吗
杀死另一个卡奥
没错  杀死另一个卡奥
占领一座城池  奴役城里的人
把他们的神像带回维斯·多斯拉克
驯服一匹野马
迫使它服从你的旨意
第一次看漂亮女人的裸体是最美妙的五件事之一
别碰我
我乃坦格利安家族的风暴降生丹妮莉丝
不焚者
弥林女王
安达尔  洛伊拿人和先民的女王
草海上的卡丽熙
解放者  龙之母
你是无名之人  蝼蚁之辈
虚无国度的卡丽熙
你是摩洛卡奥的奴隶
今晚我会睡你
如果伟大骏马开恩
你会给我生个儿子
懂了吗
我不会跟你睡
也不会给你和任何人生孩子
除非太阳从西边升起  在东边落下
我就说她是女巫
砍了她的头
我喜欢她  勇气可嘉
我是卓戈卡奥的妻子  他是拔尔勃卡奥之子
卓戈卡奥死了
我知道
我烧掉了他的遗体
原谅我  我不知道
卡奥的寡妻是不能睡的
不会有人碰你
我保证
如果你们护送我回弥林
我会送你的卡拉萨一千良马  以表谢意
卡奥死了
卡丽熙只有一个去处
维斯·多斯拉克  多希卡林的归宿
与诸多卡奥的寡妻们共度余生
大家都知道
不管什么都是有价钱的
But there has to be a price to pay for everything.
我知道  可你有没有告诉过他
I know, but have you tried telling him that?
谢谢
Thank you.
那个御林铁卫出了事  谁还敢去
Who'd go there after what happened to that Kingsguard?
-说不定是他自己惹事  -也许是的

但我不想冒险
but I'm not risking it.

明天见
See you tomorrow.
戴佛斯爵士  我们没道理开战

听见了吗  小子们  不用害怕
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.
我会赦免所有兄弟
I will grant amnesty to all brothers

至于你  戴佛斯爵士  我放你南下

a free man with a fresh horse.
还要羊肉
And some mutton.
我要一些羊肉
I'd like some mutton.

But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.
谢谢你  艾里沙爵士
Thank you, Ser Alliser.
我们商量一下
We'll discuss amongst ourselves
再给你答复
and come back to you with an answer.
小子们  我一辈子都在避免和那种人打交道
Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.
以我的阅历  只要我们打开门...
In my learned opinion, we open that door--
他们就会把我们赶尽杀绝
And they'll slaughter us all.
他们想进来  他们也进得来
They want to come in, they're gonna come in.
是  但我们不需要替他们省力气
Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them.
艾迪是我们唯一的机会
Edd is our only chance.
真他妈的可怜  忧郁的艾迪是我们唯一的机会

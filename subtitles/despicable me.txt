Justin!
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.
Justin, you get back here right now!
No, stop!
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!
Wait, wait.
Hold on. Easy, little boy.
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!
No, no, no! There he goes.
Justin!
I've got him! I've got him!
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen
and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.
There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens
try to protect their beloved landmarks.
Law enforcement still has no leads,
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains
is responsible for this heinous crime?
And where will he strike next?
I'm having a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Despicable me
Morning, Gru!
How you doing?
Hello, Fred.
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,
and I don't appreciate it.
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.
Unless they're dead.
I'm joking!
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.
Okay. Yeah.
Steamrolling whatever I see
Despicable me
I'm having a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Despicable me
You've got to be pulling on my leg!
Hello!
Cookies for sale.
Go away. I'm not home.
Yes, you are. I heard you.
No, you didn't. This
is a recording.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.
Goodbye, recorded message.
Agnes, come on.
Kyle!
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.
Gru!
Dr Nefario.
I know how you must be feeling.
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,
but in my eyes,
you will always be one of the greats.
What? What happened?
It's all over the news!
Some fella just stole a pyramid.
They're saying he makes
all other villains look
lame.
Assemble the minions!
Minions, assemble!
Okay. Okay.
Hey!
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?
All right.
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?
Hello, everybody!
Yeah, all right!
Simmer down. Simmer down!
Thank you, okay.
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.
Apparently, it's a big deal.
People are calling it
the crime of the century and stuff like that.
But am I upset? No, I am not!
A little,
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,
and you guys are all right in my book.
No, no raises!
You're not going to get any raises.
What did we do?
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!
Nice!
That's how I roll.
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?
But that's not all.
We stole the Statue of Liberty,
the small one from Las Vegas.
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,
but I have been working
on something very big!
Something that will blow this pyramid thing
out of the water!
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr Nefario...
Thank you!
There he is.
He's styling.
Now, we have located a shrink ray
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,
we will have the capability
to pull off the true crime of the century.
We are going to steal...
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
Hey.
Dave, listen up, please.
Next, we are going to steal,
pause for effect,
the moon!
And once the moon is mine,
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!
That's what I'm talking about.
Yes?
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,
and I really don't see how we can afford this.
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.
Hey, chillax.
I'll just get another loan from the bank.
They love me!
Edith, stop it!
What? I'm just walking.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
Hello, girls!
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?
Let me think.
No!
Edith! What did you put on my desk?
A mud pie.
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?
Sort of.
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.
Okay.
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.
Look at my face!
Do you still think it's a great sale day?
Eighteen coco-nutties.
I think we can do a little better than that,
don't you?
Yeah.
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.
Hi, guys.
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...
I just wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something
that's very, very big, very important.
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.
Gru to see Mr Perkins.
Yes, please have a seat.
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.
Hey.
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.
It's a mathematical term,
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.
Vector! That's me,
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.
Oh, yeah!
Check out my new weapon.
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.
Do you want a demonstration?
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.
So, all I need
is money from the bank to build a rocket.
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!
Well, very nice presentation.
I'd like to see this shrink ray.
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.
You don't have it?
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?
Apparently.
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you, Gru?
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.
If we don't start getting our money back...
Get the picture?
Look, Gru, the point is,
there are a lot of new villains out there,
younger than you, hungrier than you,
younger than you.
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.
He just stole a pyramid!
I've got it. I've got it.
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.
Suckers!
Suckers!
We got it!
What?
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!
No, no, no!
You!
Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!
So long, Gru!
Quick! We can't let him get away!
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Fire! Fire, now!
You missed me!
Come to papa!
Take that.
How adorable.
Got you in our sights!
Like taking candy from a...
What?
Hey, Gru!
Try this on for size!
That's weird. What is going...
This is claustrophobic!
No, no, no!
Too small! This is too small for me!
I hate that guy!
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears
and lay eggs in our brains.
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,
and that the mommy and daddy will be nice
and have a pet unicorn.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Unicorns, I love them
unicorns, I love them
uni, uni, unicorns
I love them
uni, unicorns, I could pet one
If they were really real
And they are
So, I bought one so I could pet it
Now it loves me
Now I love it
Don't you... What the...
Good luck, little girls!
Whoa! Cool.
Hi! We're orphans
from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.
- I don't care. Beat it!
- Come on!
We're selling cookies
so, you know, we can have a better future.
- Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
- Yeah.
Light bulb.
Dr Nefario!
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!
- What?
- Cookie robots!
- Who is this?
- Oh, forget it.
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,
Dr Gru.
And I see you have made a list
of some of your personal achievements.
Thank you for that. I love reading.
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor
and a knighthood.
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.
Kevin?
You had your own cooking show
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?
It's not that impressive.
Idiot!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
What in the name of... What?
Well, here's the dealio.
Things have been so Ionely since my wife,
Debbie, passed on.
It's like my heart is a tooth,
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.
I'm sorry.
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?
Do I look like I speak Spanish?
You have a face como un burro.
Well, thank you!
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?
So, so excited!
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.
I bet the mom is beautiful!
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.
I'm just saying it'd be nice.
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.
That's a Cheeto.
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.
Who's Debbie?
Your wife.
Hi, girls!
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.
He's going to adopt you.
And he's a dentist!
Yeah!
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.
And that's Agnes.
I got your leg, I got your leg!
Okay, that is enough, little girl.
- Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
- Higher!
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?
Some nonstick spray?
Crowbar?
Okay, girls, let's go.
Oh, yeah!
Pretty impressive!
What are you looking at?
Boo-ya!
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!
Take that!
You done been shrunk!
Yello?
I got the shrink ray, all right.
No, I'm not playing with it.
Gru?
Don't make me laugh! No.
P.S., he is not getting the moon,
and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,
he's gonna be begging for mercy.
Okay, bye.
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...
Curse you, tiny toilet!
Okay, here we are.
Home sweet home.
So, this is, like, your house?
Wait a sec...
You're the guy
who pretended he was a recorded message!
No, that was someone else.
Can I hold your hand?
No.
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.
No, hey!
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.
Girls, this is Kyle, my
dog.
Fluffy doggy!
What kind of dog is that?
He is a... I don't know.
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?
'Cause it's not.
No! No! Stay away from there!
It's fragile.
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.
Hey! It's dark in here.
It poked a hole in my juice box.
As you can see,
I have provided everything
a child might need.
All right.
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!
Somebody broke that.
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.
Rule number one.
You will not touch anything.
What about the floor?
Yes, you may touch the floor.
What about the air?
Yes, you may touch the air!
What about this?
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.
Rule number three.
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle
or sneeze or burp or fart!
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?
Does this count as annoying?
Very!
I will see you in six hours.
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?
Question. What are these?
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!
Look at this. Watch me!
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.
Why are you so old?
Okay. I'm on it.
Hello?
TV!
What is that?
- Look at that!
- That is cool!
Come on!
I don't think he's a dentist.
We've been working on this for a while.
It's a anti-gravity serum.
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.
- Do the effects wear off?
- So far,
no. No, they don't.
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.
No, no.
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering
under what circumstances
would we use this?
But, anyway.
What I really wanted to show you was this.
Now those are cookie robots!
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!
We got bored. What is this place?
Can I drink this?
Do you want to explode?
Gru!
Get back in the kitchen!
- Will you play with us?
- No.
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.
Doing what?
Okay, okay, you got me.
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.
In real life, I am a spy.
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,
- because if you do...
- What does this do?
Hey!
My unicorn!
You have to fix it.
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.
It is just a toy. Now stop it!
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!
Tim! Mark! Phil!
This is very important.
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!
Go, and hurry!
What are those?
They are my cousins.
Jerry! Stuart!
Watch them,
and keep them away from me, please.
- Wow!
- Wow!
It was your cousin's idea.
What?
Okay, bedtime.
Not you two!
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.
Just so you know,
you're never gonna be my dad.
I think I can live with that.
Are these beds made out of bombs?
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.
But try not to toss and turn.
Cool.
- Will you read us a bedtime story?
- No.
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.
Because there are literally
thousands of them.
And there's probably
something in your closet.
He's just kidding, Agnes.
It's beautiful.
Girls, let's go.
Time to deliver the cookies!
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.
Actually, we're going to have to skip
the dance class today.
Actually, we can't
skip the dance class today.
We have a big recital coming up.
- We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
- Yeah, Swan Lake!
That's fantastic. Wonderful.
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!
No.
No?
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.
Really?
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.
So if you want to go,
you are going to have to walk yourselves.
What are you doing?
Walking to dance class.
Ya? Okay, fine.
You just keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!
Okay.
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!
And you had better be in this car!
Here we go! One! Two!
...three, four and five.
And lift, and stretch.
And one, and two...
- Here you go.
- What is it?
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?
Of course, of course.
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.
Pinkie promise?
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.
But he's a V.
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.
Then we go to the B's. Then we...
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!
I was just thinking
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr Vector's first.
That is all.
Almost over. It's almost over.
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!
Do you have my cookies for me?
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes,
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.
Not likely.
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.
That'll be $52.
Right.
Seven, eight, nine...
Tic Tacs! Where was I?
Seven, eight, nine...
Why are you wearing pyjamas?
These aren't pyjamas!
This is a warm-up suit.
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.
What sort of stuff?
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.
Like sleeping?
They are not pyjamas!
Here you go, 52 big ones.
Bye!
Come on!
What the...
Quiet down, fish!
Down, boy!
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?
Life is full of disappointments
for some people.
Don't do that!
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?
No.
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!
Don't care.
- Please?
- Please?
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!
- Pretty please?
- Please?
- Come on!
- Come on!
Light bulb.
Come on!
Goodbye, have fun.
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.
What?
Oh, my gosh!
Look at that fluffy unicorn!
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!
You've gotta let us play for it!
No, no, no.
Come on!
How much for the fluffy unicorn?
Well, it is not for sale.
But all you gotta do to win it
is knock down that little spaceship there.
It's easy!
Yay!
Again!
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!
Just one more.
I accidentally closed my eyes.
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?
Do you know what that means, professor?
It means you don't get the unicorn!
Somebody's got a frowny face.
Boo! Better luck next time!
Okay, my turn.
Knocked over!
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!
That was awesome!
You blew up the whole thing!
Let's go. Let's try another game!
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?
Okay, girls, go play.
I got the shrink ray!
Cotton candy!
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.
We can't afford any distractions!
Get me Perkins.
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins,
but I figured that you would want to see this!
What?
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.
What?
Sorry. Sorry!
Could you excuse me for just one second?
I told you not to touch my things.
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.
Hey, can we order pizza?
Pizza? You just had lunch.
Not now, for dinner.
Dinner?
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!
Can we get stuffed crust?
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!
I'll stuff you all in the crust!
You're funny!
Just don't come out of that room again!
All right.
Sorry about that. Where were we?
You were sitting on the toilet.
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.
I know how much you like to laugh
inside. Now, I was saying...
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.
Believe me, I am completely focused.
- Hello!
- What?
That guy is huge!
- Are we on TV?
- What are those? Children?
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!
No, no, no!
Freeze ray!
Mr Gru?
Okay.
As I was saying...
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.
- But my plan...
- Is a great plan.
I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.
You.
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket
out of macaroni!
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!
I don't understand.
Let's face reality, Gru.
You've been at this for far too long
with far too little success.
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...
Well, a younger villain.
But I...
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.
Now, I know there have been
some rumours going around
that the bank is no longer funding us.
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.
They are true.
In terms of money,
we have no money.
So how will we get to the moon?
The answer is clear.
We won't.
We are doomed.
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.
I know.
I have fired up my resume
as I suggest that all of you do, as well.
What is it?
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?
Yes!
Yes, we will build our own rocket
using this and whatever else we can find!
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
Who needs the bank?
Let's go. Let's go!
Mom! What are you doing here?
And here he is in the bathtub.
Look at his little buns.
Mom.
Not cool.
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.
He looks like a girl!
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!
You're funny!
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!
Mr Perkins, your son is here.
Send him in.
Hey, Dad.
You wanted to see me?
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor any more.
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!
Sit down!
Do you know where the shrink ray is?
Duh! Back at my place.
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.
I guess Gru must just have one
that looks exactly like it!
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,
and you just blow it!
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?
You just wait
until Gru sees my latest weapon.
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!
There's a squid on my face!
Don't worry.
The moon is as good as ours.
Come on now, it's bedtime.
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.
You did not!
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.
Will you read us a bedtime story?
No.
Pretty please!
The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.
It is still no, so go to sleep.
But we can't. We're all hyper!
And without a bedtime story,
we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.
All night long.
Fine.
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.
Sleepy Kittens?
- What are these?
- Puppets.
You use them when you tell the story.
Okay, let's get this over with.
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?
Keep reading!
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.
"Three little kittens started to bawl,
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,
"'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur."'
Now you brush the fur.
This is literature?
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed! '
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,
"'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk."'
Now make them drink the milk.
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone,
rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'
The end. Okay, good night.
- Wait!
- What?
What about good night kisses?
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging
or kissing.
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.
I like him. He's nice.
But scary.
Like Santa!
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.
About that,
I was thinking that maybe
we could move the date of the heist.
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?
No, no, no!
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!
I just think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.
I was thinking,
maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.
It's everything we've dreamed of.
Your chance to make history,
become the man who stole the moon!
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!
They need to go.
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.
I understand.
Good.
Butt.
Butt.
Butt.
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together,
we will make the "clink" sound
with our mouths.
Ready? Edith?
- Clink.
- Clink.
There we go. And now we drink.
And Agnes?
- Clink.
- Clink.
Very good!
Excuse me, girls.
Come on!
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?
I'm here for the girls. I received a call
that you wanted to return them.
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.
I didn't like what you said.
But...
I will get the girls ready.
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!
Tell her you wanna keep us.
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.
I did it for your own good.
Come on, let's go get that moon.
Right.
What is this for?
The recital?
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six...
Oh, yeah!
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.
Boo-ya!
My flight suit.
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...
I've got it!
I've got the moon!
I've got the moon!
I can make it!
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!
Come on, come on!
He's still not here.
Why would he come? He gave us up.
But he pinkie promised!
Girls, girls, places!
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.
Can we just wait a few more minutes?
All right. But just a few more minutes.
He's not coming, guys.
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!
Okay, okay. There's the library.
That's Third Street. The dance studio...
There! There! There it is!
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.
Over?
Vector, open up!
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.
- Mr Gru!
- Zip it, Happy Meal.
Now, the girls.
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.
No!
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!
Listen close, you little punk.
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!
I'm really scared!
He is gonna kick your butt.
What? He punched my shark!
There he is!
Hang on, Gru.
Oh, no!
Vector has the girls. Go!
What happened to the ship? It's big again!
- Not as big as the moon is going to be!
- What?
The larger the mass of an object, the quicker
the effects of the shrink ray wear off!
I call it the Nefario Principle.
I just came up with it now, actually.
Oh, no!
Did you see that?
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!
- Over here!
- Hey!
What are you girls doing back there?
The moon!
Watch out!
Get as close in as you can.
You got it.
- Mr Gru, up here!
- Mr Gru!
Okay, girls! Girls!
- You're going to have to jump.
- Jump?
Are you insane?
Don't worry, I will catch you.
You gave us back!
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.
But you have to jump now.
It'll be okay.
Okay, girls.
Jump now!
Margo, I will catch you.
And I will never let you go again.
- Not so fast!
- No!
Let me go!
Margo!
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!
I got you.
No!
Oh, poop.
This time, good triumphs,
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.
But once again, law enforcement is baffled,
leaving everyone to wonder,
who is this mysterious hero?
And what will he do next?
Okay, girls. Time for bed.
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.
Tonight we are going to read a new book.
This one is called
One Big unicorn by... Who wrote this?
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!
Here, watch this.
That's the horn!
This is gonna be the best book ever!
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.
Here we go.
"One big unicorn, strong and free
"thought he was happy as he could be.
"Then three little kittens came around
"and turned his whole life upside down."
Hey, that one looks like me!
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.
"They made him laugh.
"They made him cry.
"He never should have said goodbye.
"And now he knows he could never part
"from those three little kittens
"that changed his heart.
"The end."
Okay, all right. Good night.
I love you.
I love you, too.
No, no!
All right.
Didn't I get you already?
They're very good!
I'm so proud of you, Son.
You've turned out to be a great parent!
Just like me.
Maybe even better.
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.
No, no, no!
Hey, Carl! Hey.
No, no, no.
Me, me, me.
John?
No, no. Me, me, me.
Oh, poop.
Oh, no!
Stop! Stop!
Hello, I am Gru.
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
Justin!
亲爱的 快帮我照张相
我把金字塔托在手上呢
Justin 你马上给我回来
停
- 拦住他
- 回来 不要爬上去
等一下 等一下
站住 慢慢来 小家伙
好 停 孩子 就在这儿停住 不要!
不好了 他掉下去了
Justin!
我抓住他了 我抓住他了
今晚在埃及发现了一起令人震惊的事件
吉萨金字塔被偷走了
取而代之的是一个巨大的充气复制品
这引起了全球的恐慌
与此同时各国人民
也誓要保护他们的标志性建筑
执法部门仍然没有找到任何线索
这不禁让人们好奇究竟是哪一个
恶贯满盈的歹徒
要对这起极不道德的犯罪负责任呢
他的下一个目标又是什么呢
(我今天倒霉透了)
(是时候我行我素了)
(要破坏我所见的一切)
冰冻射线  冰冻射线  冰冻射线
(我今天倒霉透了)
(如果你要往心里去 那也无所谓)
(瞧 这多有趣)
(卑鄙的我)
早上好 Gru
你好吗?
你好 Fred
顺便让你知道一下
你的狗在我的院子里到处便便
可我并不需要狗便便
对不起 你知道狗狗总是随心所欲的
除非他们死了
骗到你啦
虽然事实是这样
好啦 祝你今天愉快
好的
(破坏我所看见的一切)
(卑鄙的我)
(我今天倒霉透了)
(如果你要往心里去 无所谓)
(卑鄙的我)
别这样搞我吧
有人吗?
要买小饼干吗
走开 我不在家
你在的 我听到你声音了
不 你听错了
这是答录机
- 不 不是
- 是的
听好了 请留言 哔
再见 录音器
Agnes 走吧
Kyle!
可恶的狗 不  不
坐下 我的松饼
Gru
Nefario博士
我知道你的感受
我也觉得非常遗憾
但在我眼中 你永远是最棒的
发生什么事了?
所有的新闻都在报道
有个家伙把金字塔偷了
他们说其他坏人和他比起来显得
逊色
集中小奴才!
小奴才 集合!
好的 好的
嗨
Kevin 看上去不错嘛
家里人都好吗
好的
我的小宝贝 Larry 好吗?
大家好
好啦
安静 安静
谢谢
我想你们都听说了
关于金字塔被别的坏人偷走的事了
很显然 这是件大事
大家都说这是一个划时代的创举啥的
但我生气了吗?  不 我没有!
一点点
但是我们这一年的成绩相当不错
我认为你们都很棒
没有加薪
你的工资是不会加的
我们都干了些什么
我们偷了时代广场的大电视屏幕!
正点!
看我多厉害
你们都喜欢用它看橄榄球比赛　是吧
不止这些
我们还偷了自由神像
在拉斯维加斯的那座小的
更别提艾菲尔铁塔了
也是拉斯维加斯的
好了 本来我不打算告诉你们的
我正在进行一项非常伟大的计划
和这件事毕金字塔这事马上就要变浮云啦
同时非常感谢我的好朋友
Nefario博士的大力相助
谢谢
他在那
很有型啊
我们在一个秘密实验室里发现了
一种收缩射线 一旦我们得到它
我们就有能力
创造真正的划时代犯罪行为
我们准备要偷取...
等一下 我还没告诉你们是什么
嗨
Dave 听好了
下一步 我们将要去偷
来个定格效果
月亮!
一旦月亮到我手
他们就会对我有求必应以换回月亮
而我将成为世界上最伟大的坏人
这才是我想要的
什么事
喂 Gru? 我算了一下
我们负担不起进行计划的费用
这个计划完成不了 我不是魔术师
放心
我会去银行再贷款的 他们喜欢我
Edith 别再这样了
干嘛? 我走路而已
- Hattie老师 我们回来了
- Hattie老师 我们回来了
姑娘们 你们好
我们不在的时候有人来领养我们吗
让我想一想
没有
Edith 你放什么在我桌上呢
泥巴馅饼
Edith 你永远不会被领养的 知道吗
- 我知道
- 好极了
孩子们进行得怎样了
达到目标了吗
差不多
我们卖了四十三个迷你薄荷 三十个巧克力圈圈
还有十八个可可果仁
好
嗯 好像你们卖得很好嘛
看着我
你们还认为是这样吗
十八个可可果仁
我觉得我们可以做得更好一点 是吗
是呀
你们周末不会想要呆在盒子里反省吧
- 不 Hattie老师
- 不 Hattie老师
好极了 可以走了 帮我整理一下东西
- 嗨 Penny
- 嗨 Penny
嗨 你们好
嗨 妈妈 对不起
我本来想打电话的 可是...
我只是想恭喜你偷了金字塔
是你干的 是吧?
还是另外一个成功的混混干的?
妈 告诉你 我将要做
一件非常非常大和重要的计划
如果你知道了一定会感到很骄傲
祝你好运 我要走了
(恶魔银行)
Gru 我约了Perkins先生
好的 请坐
这是人类的一小步
全人类的一大步
妈 我有一天也要上月球
儿子 来不及了
美国宇航局不再送猴子到那儿做实验了
我正在申请一个新的坏人贷款
用Vector这个名字
这是个数学术语
表示方向和数量
Vector 那就是我
因为我犯的罪都是有来头的
看看我的新武器
水虎鱼枪 酷!
以前有看到过吗
你肯定没看过 我发明的
糟糕 有时候把鱼塞回枪膛很难...
Gru先生 Perkins先生现在可以见你了
所以 我要的
就是从银行借钱造一架火箭
- 然后 月亮就是我们的了
- 哇
嗯 陈述得非常好
我希望可以看一下这个收缩射线
没问题 我很快就会有了
你还没有?
你这样也有脸向银行借钱?
显然易见的
你知道这间银行已经投资
在你身上多少资金了吗 Gru
你有什么阴谋坏事做了是赚钱的
我怎么投?  比方说这个苹果是你
如果我们不将借出去的钱拿回来
知道后果了吗
Gru 我要说的是
新坏人不断涌现
他们比你年轻 比你饥饿
比你年轻
象那边的小男孩叫Vector
他刚偷走了金字塔
了解 了解
所以 谈到借钱造火箭...
先把收缩射线弄到手 我们再谈吧
白痴
白痴
我们拿到了
什么
嗨 嗨 嗨
不 不 不
你
在你冰冻别人的脑袋前你要三思
再会 Gru
快 不能让他跑了
高一点 高一点

没打到我
哥拼了
拿着吧
真可爱
看到你了
就像把糖果从...
不是吧
嗨 Gru
试一下这个
真奇怪 发生什么。。。
这是幽闭恐怖症
不 不是的
太小了  这个太小了
我讨厌那家伙
请看护着我们 保佑我们睡个好觉
还有保佑我们睡着的时候虫子
不会爬进我们的耳朵
和在我们的脑袋里下蛋
谢谢你的想象力 Edith
请保佑我们很快就会被领养
新爸爸妈妈对我们很好
还有一只独角兽宠物
阿门
- 阿门
- 阿门
独角兽 我最喜欢他们了
独角兽 我也喜欢他们

生活显得很孤单自从我的太太
Debbie 不在了
就像我的心是一颗牙
然后长了蛀牙 只能由孩子们来填补牙洞
对不起
你是位漂亮的女士
你讲西班牙语吗
我看上去像会讲西班牙语吗
你的脸太美了
谢谢
我们可以继续领养手续了吗
太激动了
请叫Margo Edith和Agnes到大厅来
我打赌妈妈一定很漂亮
我说爸爸的眼睛会闪闪光
他们的房子一定都是用
Gummi Bear糖做的
我只是说说而已
我的毛毛虫永远也不会变成蝴蝶了
那是一个Cheeto(芝士做的零食)
Debbie真是幸运
谁是Debbie?
你太太

你似乎没怎么用心做事啊 Gru
相信我 我一向很用心做事的
- 你好啊

你们在干嘛?
我不是说了要你们出去吗!
别 别 别

就像我所说的...
你不必说了 我已经看够了
- 但是我的计划...
- 很棒的计划
我喜欢你计划里的一切 除了一件事
就是你
看 妈妈 我画了张我登月的图!
看 妈妈
我用通心粉做了个火箭模型!
看 妈妈
我参照通心粉的模型做了个真的火箭!
我不明白
面对现实吧 Gru
虽然你一直在努力
可是总不能成功
我们将把我们的信心
我们的钱放到一个...
一个更年轻的坏蛋身上
但我...
都结束了 再见 Gru
我知道最近出现了些谣言
说银行不会再资助我们了
我就是来澄清谣言的
谣言是真的
就资金而言
我们是没有钱了
那我们要怎么上月球呢
答案再明显不过了
我们去不了了
我们失败了
你们是时候去找份新工作了
我知道
我已经把我的简历给烧了
我也建议你们这么做
怎么了
没看见我正在激励大家吗
好呀
好的 我们来建自己的火箭
用这个 还有任何我们能找到的东西
把所有东西都拿上
去废品回收站  把那些旧车给拆了
谁还需要银行啊
我们走 我们走
妈妈  你在这干嘛?
这是他正在浴缸里的照片
看看他的小屁屁
妈妈
一点都不好玩
这张 他穿上了他最好的衣服
他看起来像个女孩
没错  是的  一个难看的女孩
你真可爱
真棒  我的看起来像个死人
Perkins先生 你儿子来了
让他进来
嗨 爸爸
你想见我?

Victor这名字傻死了
现在我叫Vector

你知道缩小激光枪在哪吗
就在我那放着呢
是吗 在你那放着吗
那真是不错啊
那Gru是正好有了个一样的咯!
等下...这些小女孩卖过饼干给我
你知道这个偷月计划有多赚钱吗
我给你了次千载难逢的机会
你却白白断送了
- 不 我没有
- 是吗
你就等着让Gru看我的终极武器吧
鱿鱼发射器  欧耶
怎么有只鱿鱼盖我脸上了
别担心
月亮会是我们的
好了 过来 该上床睡觉了
你刷牙没?
让我闻闻 让我闻闻
你没刷
穿上你们的睡衣
别捣乱了 好了 我说真的 真的
该睡觉了 现在就去
我没在开玩笑 快睡
- 我们还不累呢
- 但我累了
能给我们讲个睡前故事吗
不行
求你了
说多少个"求你了"也没用
回答还是不行 所以快睡觉
我们睡不着 我们还这么兴奋
如果不讲睡前故事的话
我们就会不断的起床打扰你滴
整个晚上
好吧
好 好 沉睡的小猫
沉睡的小猫?
- 这是什么
- 手指玩偶
你可以戴着它们给我们讲故事
好吧 让我们开始吧
"有三只小猫 它们很爱玩耍
它们在阳光下疯玩了一整天"
"这时它们的妈妈来了说
'小猫们该睡觉了‘'"
哇 这故事真烂
你们真的喜欢这个?
继续讲啊
- 快点继续
- 好 好 好
"这三只小猫就开始哭着说"
"'妈妈 我们还一点都不想睡呢'"
"它们的妈妈笑了笑 回答说"
705
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,315
"'好吧 但你们至少
要先梳理梳理自己的毛'"
现在你帮它们梳毛
这也算儿童文学?
两岁的小孩子都能写了 好吧
"三只小猫把毛都梳理了"
"然后说 '我们睡不着
我们还兴奋着呢'"
"她们的妈妈柔声回答到"
"'好吧 那你们应该至少先喝个牛奶吧'"
现在给它们喝牛奶吧
我不喜欢这书
这没完没了的
"三只小猫喝了牛奶后
眼皮开始打架 打起了哈切"
"'我们还是睡不着 我们还不困'
然后它们的妈妈唱了支摇篮曲 "
"'小猫们晚安 闭上眼睛吧
愿你们一觉安睡到天亮"
"'尽管当你们睡着时
我们不在一起"
"'但你们的妈妈
永远全心全意地爱你们'"
故事讲完了 好了 晚安
- 等等
- 怎么了又?
还有晚安吻呢
不行 不行
不会有晚安吻 抱抱还有吻之类的
他不会给我们晚安吻的 Agnes
我喜欢他 他挺好的
就长得有点吓人
像圣诞老人!
离火箭发射只有48小时了
整个系统已经准备好了
关于这个
我在想可不可以推迟几天
千万别告诉我这是因为要去看
这几个小姑娘的舞蹈表演 好吗
不是 不是 不是
舞蹈表演会?
绝对不是...这么傻的玩意
我只是觉得在星期六发射有点奇怪
我只是觉得
或许星期二去偷月不错 对吗
Gru 我们都为这工作了几十年了
这就是我们的夙愿
这是改写历史的机会
成为偷月的第一人!
但这些女孩会让你分心的
她们得离开
如果你不采取行动的话
我就会了
我明白了
很好
屁股
屁股
屁股
好了  当我们碰杯时
我们要说"干杯"
准备好没 Edith?
- 干杯
- 干杯
来吧 现在喝了它
接下来 Agnes?
- 干杯
- 干杯
很好!
很抱歉 姑娘们
拜托
别担心 我马上就回 你们继续干杯
- 干杯 干杯
- 干杯 干杯
Hattie小姐 有何贵干
我是为姑娘们来的
我接到电话说你想把她们送回去
还有 我专门买了本西班牙字典
我不喜欢你说的
但...
我会让姑娘们准备好的
别让她带我们走 Gru先生
告诉她你想让我们留下来
好了 姑娘们 来吧 我们走
再见了 Gru先生
感谢你所做的一切
我是为你好
来吧 让我们偷月吧
好的
这是干嘛的
舞蹈表演会?
我可是本世纪最伟大的罪犯
我才不会去
这些小女孩的舞蹈表演会呢
开启顶上舱门
开始发射程序
我们将在十秒后出发
十 九 八 七

干的漂亮 博士 一切正常
我的飞行服
再来一次 强大的...
我拿到了!
我拿到了月亮!

他还没来
他为什么要来?
他已经不要我们了
但他已经和我拉钩答应的了
姑娘们 姑娘们 要开始了
还不能开始
我们还在等一个人
能再等等吗
好吧 但只有几分钟
他不会来的 大家
Gru  Gru 能听到我说话吗
快 我们得警告他 要快!
好的 好的 这是图书馆
那是第三大街 舞蹈厅...
那! 那! 在那!
抱歉 兄弟 演出已经结束了
结束了?
(Margo Edith和Agnes的爸爸)
(带上月亮 V)
Vector 快开门
先把月亮给我
然后我们再谈
- Gru先生
- 闭嘴 小甜心们
现在 可以放了她们了吧
事实上 我觉得我还要多留她们一阵
不行!
当然可以  难以预料吧
给我听好了 你个小废物
要是我进去了 你就惨了
我好害怕哟
他绝对会把你臭扁一顿的
什么 他居然打了我的鲨鱼
他在那
抓紧 Gru
噢 不要!
姑娘们在Vector手上 快走!
这船怎么回事  怎么又变大了
- 反正不会比月亮大
- 什么
你缩小的对象越大
缩小射线的作用消失得就越快
我称之为Nefario定律
其实 我也是刚想到的
不是吧
你们看见没?
- Vector!  救命!
- Vector!
- 快看这
- 嗨
你们几个在那搞什么鬼?
月亮!
小心!
快点靠近啊
行了
- Gru先生 我们在这
- Gru先生
好了 姑娘们  姑娘们
- 你们得跳下来
- 跳下去?
你疯了吗
别担心 我会接住你们的
你都抛弃我们了
我知道 我知道
这是我犯过的最大的错
但你们得马上跳下来
会没事的
好了 姑娘们
快跳
Margo 我会接住你的
而且再也不会放手
- 别想这么快走
- 不要!
让我走
Margo!
我来了 Margo 抓住!
抓到你了
不!
天那
这次 是好消息
月亮又回到了它在天上的位置
但再一次的 政府部门也很困惑
大家都在想
这次的神秘英雄是谁?
他的下一步行动是什么呢
好了 姑娘们 该睡觉了
- 行了  我们想要睡前故事
- 三只沉睡的小猫
不行  抱歉
那本书碰巧被完全损坏了
今晚我们要讲个新故事
叫做
一只大的独角兽 作者是...
谁写的呢?
哦 我!  我写的 看
还是个有手指玩偶的书哟!
来 看看这个
这是角
这肯定会是最好的书!
我也不想吹牛
但 没错  或许会是
我们开始吧
"有一个大的 强壮的 自由的独角兽"
"他总是自以为快乐的生活着"
"突然三只小猫闯进了他的生活"
"然后改变了他整个的生活"
嗨 那只猫跟我好像!
不是 你在说什么呢
这是些小猫
如有雷同 肯定纯属巧合
"它们让他笑"
"让他哭"
"他最不该的就是和它们说再见"
"现在他知道"
"他永远不能和这三只"
"改变了他的心的小猫分离"
"故事讲完了"
好了 晚安
我爱你
我也爱你
不行 不行
好吧
我不是已经亲过你了吗
她们跳得很好
我真为你骄傲 儿子
你成了一个很棒的家长
就像我一样
或许比我还要好
不 谢了 你们继续吧
不 不 不
嗨 Carl! 嗨
不 不 不

John?
